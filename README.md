# SuicidePrediction-TextProcessing
## Goal
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can detect suicidal intent from text data. By analyzing user-generated posts, the model aims to classify whether a text indicates suicidal thoughts or not. This predictive model can serve as an essential tool in mental health monitoring, helping organizations, therapists, and online platforms to identify individuals at risk and provide timely intervention.

## Summary
This project leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning to analyze and classify text from the Suicide Watch dataset on Kaggle. The dataset consists of textual data labeled as suicidal or non-suicidal, making it ideal for a binary classification problem.

### Data Preprocessing:

* Cleaning text data (removing stopwords, tokenization, vectorization using TF-IDF).

* Handling missing values.

### Machine Learning Models Used:

* Logistic Regression â€“ A simple yet effective baseline model.
* Random Forest Classifier â€“ A robust tree-based model.
* XGBoost Classifier â€“ A powerful gradient boosting model for better accuracy.
  
### Evaluation Metrics:

* Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC to assess model performance.

## Importance of Suicide Detection from Text

### Early Intervention:

Timely identification of suicide-related posts can help mental health professionals intervene before it's too late.

### Automated Monitoring for Social Media & Forums:

Online platforms can use AI-driven detection to flag posts that indicate distress, enabling proactive mental health support.

### Reducing Suicide Rates:

Suicide is a major public health issue, and AI-powered detection can assist in prevention strategies.

### Scalability & Efficiency:

Machine learning allows rapid and large-scale analysis of online text, making it scalable for various applications in mental health.

By implementing AI-driven suicide detection, this research contributes to the growing field of mental health analytics, ensuring that technology plays a vital role in saving lives. ðŸš€
